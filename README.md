# Multi-URL Arbitrage Monitor

A Python-based arbitrage monitoring tool that scrapes prediction markets (specifically designed for Polymarket) to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple betting outcomes. The tool automatically checks for price discrepancies that could result in guaranteed profits and provides Discord notifications for real-time alerts.

## Features

- **Multi-URL Monitoring**: Monitor multiple prediction markets simultaneously
- **Real-time Arbitrage Detection**: Automatically calculates arbitrage margins and identifies profitable opportunities
- **Discord Integration**: 
  - Instant notifications for arbitrage opportunities
  - Separate log channel for detailed monitoring
  - Summary reports after each scan cycle
- **Trading Calculator**: Interactive tool to calculate optimal stake distribution for identified opportunities
- **Robust Data Extraction**: Uses both Selenium and BeautifulSoup for reliable web scraping
- **Cross-platform Logging**: Comprehensive logging with fallback locations for different operating systems
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues monitoring even if individual URLs fail

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

### Chrome WebDriver
This script requires Chrome WebDriver for Selenium automation. Install it using one of these methods:

#### Option 1: Using ChromeDriver Manager (Recommended)
```bash
pip install webdriver-manager
```

#### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
2. Add it to your system PATH

## Configuration

### Required Setup
Before running the script, you need to configure several parameters in the `main.py` file:

#### 1. URLs to Monitor
Add the Polymarket URLs you want to monitor:
```python
urls = [
    "https://polymarket.com/event/your-first-market",
    "https://polymarket.com/event/your-second-market",
    # Add more URLs here
]
```

#### 2. Discord Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)
Create Discord webhooks for notifications:
```python
webhook_url = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_MAIN_WEBHOOK'
log_webhook_url = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_LOG_WEBHOOK'  # Optional
```

**To create Discord webhooks:**
1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook and copy the URL
4. Optionally create a second webhook for detailed logs

#### 3. CSS Selectors
The script uses CSS selectors to extract data. Update these if Polymarket changes their structure:
```python
price_class = "c-dhzjXW c-dhzjXW-jVLVTy-zIndex-1 c-dhzjXW-bZmKkd-justifyContent-end c-dhzjXW-fVlWzK-gap-3"
outcome_class = "c-dhzjXW c-dhzjXW-bZmKkd-justifyContent-end c-dhzjXW-jroWjL-alignItems-center"
```

#### 4. Check Interval
Set how frequently to check for arbitrage opportunities:
```python
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 5  # Check every 5 minutes
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arbitrage-monitor.git
cd arbitrage-monitor
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure the script:**
   - Edit `main.py` to add your URLs and Discord webhooks
   - Adjust CSS selectors if necessary

4. **Run the script:**
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Starting the Monitor
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
- Start monitoring all configured URLs
- Check for arbitrage opportunities at the specified interval
- Send Discord notifications when opportunities are found
- Log all activities to a log file

### Interactive Commands
While the monitor is running, you can use these commands:

- **`trade`**: View all available trades and calculate stake distributions
- **`quit`** or **`exit`**: Stop the monitor
- **`Ctrl+C`**: Gracefully shutdown the monitor

### Understanding the Output

#### Console Output
```
üéØ ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY!
üìä Market: bitcoin-price-september-5
üí∞ Margin: 3.45%
üè∑Ô∏è Prices: [45.2, 56.8]
üìà Odds: [2.21, 1.76]
‚è∞ Time: 14:30:15
```

#### Trading Table
When you select a trade, you'll see a detailed breakdown:
```
Trading table for: bitcoin-price-september-5
Distribution of the stake among the odds should be as follows:

Outcome Name    | Yes Price    | Odd      | Stake      | Payout    
----------------------------------------------------------------
Yes             | 45.2         | 2.21     | 452.49     | 1000.00   
No              | 56.8         | 1.76     | 547.51     | 1000.00   

Total profit would be: 34.50
```

## How Arbitrage Detection Works

The script identifies arbitrage opportunities by:

1. **Extracting Prices**: Scrapes "Yes" prices from each outcome in a market
2. **Converting to Odds**: Converts prices to decimal odds using: `Odd = 100 / Price`
3. **Calculating Arbitrage Constant**: Sums the inverse of all odds: `Œ£(1/Odd)`
4. **Determining Margin**: Calculates profit margin: `(100/Arbitrage_Constant) - 100`

**Positive margin = Arbitrage opportunity exists**

## File Structure

```
arbitrage-monitor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main script file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log.txt              # Log file (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Logging

The script creates comprehensive logs including:
- All arbitrage checks and results
- Error messages and warnings
- Trading calculations
- System status updates

**Log file locations** (tries in order):
1. Same directory as script: `./log.txt`
2. Home directory: `~/arbitrage_log.txt`
3. Desktop: `~/Desktop/arbitrage_log.txt`
4. Temp directory: `/tmp/arbitrage_log.txt`

## Discord Notifications

### Main Channel Notifications
- üéØ Arbitrage opportunities with details
- üìã Scan summaries with opportunity counts
- üöÄ System startup/shutdown messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical errors

### Log Channel (Optional)
- Detailed monitoring logs
- All console output mirrored to Discord
- Technical debugging information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No prices found"
- **Cause**: CSS selectors may be outdated due to website changes
- **Solution**: Inspect the webpage and update `price_class` and `outcome_class`

#### Chrome WebDriver errors
- **Cause**: ChromeDriver not installed or incompatible version
- **Solution**: Update ChromeDriver to match your Chrome version

#### Permission denied for log file
- **Cause**: Insufficient write permissions
- **Solution**: The script automatically tries fallback locations

#### Discord notifications not working
- **Cause**: Invalid webhook URL
- **Solution**: Verify webhook URLs are correct and active

### CSS Selector Updates

If Polymarket changes their website structure, you'll need to update the CSS selectors:

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Inspect the price elements** and outcome name elements
3. **Copy the class names**
4. **Update the configuration** in `main.py`
